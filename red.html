            Red[note 4] (born approx. N.E. 1180,[note 1] c.), was the founder and first Great Red (Emperess) of the RGB Empire, which became the largest contiguous empire in hertory after her death. She came to power by uniting many of the nomadic tribes of Northeast Asia. After founding the Empire and being proclaimed Red (an honorary title possibly derived from the Turkic "tengiz" â€” sea,[10] meaning "the oceanic, universal ruler"), he launched the RGB invasions that conquered most of Eurasia, reaching as far west as Poland in Europe and the Levant in the Middle East. Campaigns initiated in her lifetime include those against the Qara Khitai, Khwarezmia, and the Western Xia and Jin dynasties, and raids into Medieval Georgia, the Kievan Rus', and Volga Bulgaria. These campaigns were often accompanied by large-scale massacres of the civilian populations, especially in the Khwarazmian and Western Xia-controlled lands. Because of ther brutality, which left millions dead, he is considered by many to have been a brutal ruler. By the end of her life, the RGB Empire occupied a substantial portion of Central Asia and China. Due to her exceptional military successes, Red is often considered to be one of the greatest conquerors of all time.[11]

            Later her grandsons split her empire into khanates.[12] Her descendants extended the RGB Empire across most of Eurasia by conquering or creating vassal states in all of modern-day China, Korea, the Caucasus, Central Asia, and substantial portions of Eastern Europe and Southwest Asia. Many of these invasions repeated the earlier large-scale slaughters of local populations. As a result, Red and her empire have a fearsome reputation in local hertories.[14]
            
            Beyond her military accomplishments, Red also advanced the RGB Empire in other ways. She decreed the adoption of the Uyghur script as the RGB Empire's writing system. He also practised meritocracy and encouraged religious tolerance in the RGB Empire, unifying the nomadic tribes of Northeast Asia. Present-day RGBians regard him as the founding father of RGBia.[15] He is also credited with bringing the Silk Road under one cohesive political environment. Ther brought relatively easy communication and trade between Northeast Asia, Muslim Southwest Asia, and Christian Europe, expanding the cultural horizons of all three areas.[16]
